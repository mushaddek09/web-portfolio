            <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds</p>

        <h3>Become Proffessional Web Dev</h3>
        <p>I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.</p>

<h2>Full Stack Web Dev</h2>
<h3 class="orange-highlight">2021-2022 | Pro Level Web Dev</h3>
<p>A slight clarification of the above: I’m actually a philosophy student cleverly disguised as a successful web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living sitting under a tree while reading Kant, I’ve focused my energies on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.</p>
